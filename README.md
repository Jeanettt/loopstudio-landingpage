# Loopstudio landingpage
This is front end exercise I did from frontendmentor.io. The goal was to create a pixel perfect and interactive landing page using modern HTML5, CSS and ES6 javascript.

## Approach
1. This was the first time I used Git, so I had to set it up.
2. Then I started structuring the HTML.
3. I added CSS for the layout (Grid and Flexbox).
4. Then I added the fonts, colors and other styling.
5. I added the animations, like the hover bar under the menu items and the hover state of the image grid.
6. And finally I configured the mobile menu using some clunky JavaScript in the HTML file. 

## Lessons learned
1. Looking back I could've better put that JS logic in a different file and simply changed the class on hamburger element. But that's for my next project!
